# Trip Definition Files
This folder is for trip definition files created by running `OD2TRIPS`.

Trip files can be directly input into a SUMO simulation for dynamic user assignment, however this can be very computationally intensive for a full scale simulation.

Routes can be pre-computed by running `DUAROUTER` with the corresponding `*_router.cfg.xml` files in this directory.
